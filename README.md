This is my pet-project thet I created during my 4th year at my university. It consists from two subproject: 
    DecaySpectrumSimulation - program for simulation decay spectrum from radioactive substance on scintillation detector.
    DecaySpectrumAnalysis - program for automatic search and characterization of energy source in decay spectrum
