This is the pet project that I created during my 4th year (2020) at my university. It consists of two subprojects:  

*DecaySpectrumSimulation* - program for simulation of decay spectrum from the radioactive substance on a scintillation detector.

*DecaySpectrumAnalysis* - program for automatic search and characterization of energy sources in decay spectrum.

Each subproject (folder) contains a "HowToUse" file that gives additional information.
